"27","Employee 1","Low energy equipment","core","Cost","criterion",25,"optimistic","60","This involves buying new equipment so it is relatively costly"
"28","Employee 1","Low energy equipment","core","Cost","criterion",25,"pessimistic","50","Although buying low energy equipment is an expense, we would re-coup costs by paying less for energy over time"
"29","Employee 1","Recycle equipment","core","Cost","criterion",25,"optimistic","70","It is not too expensive to recycle equipment"
"30","Employee 1","Recycle equipment","core","Cost","criterion",25,"pessimistic","55","But we do have to pay to recycle equipment so there is a cost"
"31","Employee 1","Recycle materials","core","Cost","criterion",25,"optimistic","70","It is not too expensive to recycle materials"
"32","Employee 1","Recycle materials","core","Cost","criterion",25,"pessimistic","55","But we do have to pay to recycle materials so there is a cost"
