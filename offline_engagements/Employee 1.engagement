Thus it serves three purposes: First, to generate a wider set of ideas. Second, to understand where are the areas of uncertainty, context-dependency and disagreement. Third, to  explore a consensus regarding what we think look like the best ideas under most views and conditions. \r\n\r\nThe project deadline is in two months.","archived":false,"deleted":false,"last_synced":"2019-07-19T09:50:00Z","sync_job_id":null,"is_example":true,"last_synced_by":25},"optiongroups":[{"id":"07f74566281344cc94a61a81c2f56e3f","order":0,"label":"More Recycling","created":"2014-10-16T14:27:59Z","modified":"2014-10-16T14:27:59Z","description":"Increase the volume and efficacy of recycling provision ","read_only":true,"member_count":2},{"id":"ecd0661fa5a343ab8d34f3c66c1187f8","order":1,"label":"Green Energy","created":"2014-10-16T14:27:59Z","modified":"2014-10-16T14:27:59Z","description":"Reduce adverse environmental and social impacts of energy use","read_only":true,"member_count":3},{"id":"d202a8aed251410aa74aea599fdb9e13","order":2,"label":"Reduce Impacts","created":"2014-10-16T14:27:59Z","modified":"2014-10-16T14:27:59Z","description":"Reduce inputs and outputs of environmentally harmful substances","read_only":true,"member_count":3}],"criteriongroups":[{"id":"d370f3dda04648baa9381f3213a90747","order":0,"label":"Criteria","created":"2015-02-02T13:22:23Z","modified":"2015-02-02T13:22:23Z","description":"Test","member_count":4}],"options":[{"id":"de0a9301623a402595af81c21468221b","order":0,"label":"Recycle materials","type":"core","summary_definition":"Achieve standards of practice at least equal to best in the sector","full_definition":"Secure contracts with independently accredited suppliers for recycling of all office paper, all canteen food wastes and 90% (by volume) of manufacturing residues.
